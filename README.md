```
Currently the Steam Deck has
no way of turning off the screen
when a download or update is
running. This is a tiny app
that launches into a fullscreen
blank black screen, so that
the Steam Deck can run background
downloads.
I'm really scared of OLED burn in :(.

Make sure that the app has background
downloading enabled before launching,
otherwise it will pause the download.
